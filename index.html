        <h2>The Company</h2>
        <p>
            Our company was founded on the basis that everyone should have equal access to quality, delicious donuts no matter their dietary restrictions. 
            Our donuts are free from the <strong>eight major allergens</strong> including <strong>milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, 
            and soybeans.</strong> Everyone is welcome at Fred the Baker Baking Company!
